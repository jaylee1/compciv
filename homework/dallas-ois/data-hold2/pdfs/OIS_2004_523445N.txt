On Saturday, July 10, 2004, at 6:30 A.M, a uniformed patrol officer in a marked vehicle was traveling westbound on Knight Street when he noticed a suspicious vehicle. As the officer turned around to investigate, the vehicle occupied by a W/M/26 suspect sped off. The suspect was located walking on Lemmon Avenue. The suspect then failed to comply with verbal commands by the officer and a struggle between the officer and suspect ensued. The suspect then fled on foot while holding a handgun in his hand. The suspect ran to the porch of 4122 Rawlings Street, began pacing back and forth holding the weapon to his head. The officer gave verbal commands to the suspect to put the gun down, but the suspect raised the gun and pointed it at the officer. The officer fired his weapon striking him. The suspect bent forward then stood up again and raised his gun at the officer. The officer fired his weapon at the suspect striking him again. The officer then heard two shots come from where the suspect had fallen to the ground. It was determined by the Dallas Medical Examiner that suspect’s fatal wound was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Suspect was pronounced deceased at the scene. Suspect weapon was a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, 2 fired rounds. The suspect’s gun had the serial number scratched off. No officer was injured.
