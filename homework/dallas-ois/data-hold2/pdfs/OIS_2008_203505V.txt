On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximately 9:15 P.M., a uniformed off-duty officer was working in an off duty capacity for a business at 2900 Wheatland Road. The officer reported an armed B/M suspect entered the business and forced him to the cash room. There he demanded employees open the cash room door. An employee disrupted the robbery by initiating the fire alarm. The suspect then directed the officer to a field adjacent to the business. The officer reported hearing the hammer click back and believing he was about to be shot by the suspect, pushed the suspect aside who fled on foot. The suspect stopped after a few feet and looked back at the officer, at which time the officer fired 3 times at the suspect missing him. The offense was later unfounded. The officer was terminated for a violation of departmental policy and charged with Aggravated Robbery. Involved Officer: B/M/ 3 years, 10 months service.
