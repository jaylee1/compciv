On Wednesday, October 2, 2013, at approximately 10:30 P.M., uniformed officers in a marked squad car were working a Prostitute Diversionary Initiative in the area of 1339 Morrell. As officers drove through the area they were using their spot light which was shone on the B/M/41 suspect. The suspect stated that he would “get a light”. The suspect entered a nearby apartment. The officers pulled their squad car into the parking lot to further investigate and observed the suspect step out of the apartment and shine a light at the officers. Officers then saw the muzzle flash of a gun firing and heard the gunshot. Both officers returned fire, but did not strike the suspect. The suspect was not injured. Two handguns were recovered from the suspect’s apartment. The suspect was no-billed by a Grand Jury. No officer was injured. Two officers fired 11 rounds. Involved Officers: L/M 3 years, 11 months service, L/M 3 years, 11 months service.
