On Sunday, May 27, 2006, at approximately 9:10 A.M., a plainclothes off-duty officer received a loud music disturbance at 2208 N. Carroll Avenue, the apartment complex where he resided and worked as a courtesy officer. The officer advised the intoxicated W/M/31 suspect to turn the music down and that he needed to pick up the chairs and broken bottles that he had been throwing off of the second story balcony.
